        <p class="lead">
            Most students find exams stressful.
            But spending time thinking negative thoughts about exams wonâ€™t help you to achieve better marks or motivate you to prepare properly.
            Instead realise that there are positive things about exams. This will help you to stay calm and motivated during your preparation.

                        <li>Exams can energise us, providing motivation to learn things we would otherwise keep putting off.</li>
                        <li> They provide the incentive to make us look back over what we have already covered in order to check that we really understand it. They encourage us to find ways of remembering information without having to look it up.</li>
                        <li> They can show us what we really know, as opposed to what we thought we knew. We are likely to discover aspects we need to know better, and even to learn more than we realised we could.</li>

                        <li> They require us to manage our time and to plan well; this can help us to develop better project management skills.</li>
                        <li> They provide us with a challenge. If we learn to cope with them, we are likely to emerge stronger, more able to cope with other challenges in our lives, irrespective of the marks we get in the exam. With enough, practice and revision, most people can get through exams, but it takes courage to take the exam in the first place.</li>
                        <li> They offer a chance to gain qualifications that are stepping stones to further progress.</li>
